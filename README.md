To-Do-List For MainFrame and Baby Entry:
  1. Allow for the Combobox to update correctly when new baby is entered into database.
  2. Update database for Baby to allow for image location to be saved so that image box can be updated.
  3. Allow for a image box to be updated when a new baby is selected from Combobox.
  4. Make sure all data is being correctly added to the database for each baby.
  5. Work on creating the update form for baby list to be updated if needed (mostly focus on the picture update here)
