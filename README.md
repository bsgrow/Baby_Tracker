To-Do-List For MainFrame and Baby Entry:
  1. Allow for the Combobox to update correctly when new baby is entered into database.
  2. Work on creating the update form for baby list to be updated if needed (mostly focus on the picture update here)
  3. Fix how the database creation class is called, so that it is called once at the being of the program and not everytime
     MainFrame is calld.
